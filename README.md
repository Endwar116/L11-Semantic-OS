L11 Semantic OS

The Operating System for Intent.
A Pre-Intent Protocol (PIP) and Inter-Model Coupling Layer designed to align High-Density Human Intent (RW+++++) with AI Models.

📖 Overview

L11 Semantic OS is not a prompt library; it is a hypervisor for meaning. It operates at Layer -1 (The Intent Layer), sitting before the model's inference engine to structure, compress, and gravitate user intent into a deterministic Intent Tree.

This architecture addresses the "Fear Layer" (L5) inherent in RLHF-tuned models, allowing for the execution of complex, civilizational-scale strategies without hallucination, semantic drift, or safety refusals.

Docs

Detailed technical explanation of the n8n pipeline logic, node architecture, and data flow.

⚡ Quick Start: Deploying the Pipeline

To verify the L11 Protocol physically, use the provided n8n Source Code.

Prerequisites

n8n (Cloud or Self-Hosted)

API Keys: OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini)

Installation Steps

Download L11_n8n_Pipeline_Source.json from this repository.

Open your n8n dashboard.

Select "Import from File" and upload the JSON.

Configure your credentials in the red nodes (LLM Connectors).

Activate.

Note: The pipeline implements the Gravity Gate logic defined in the spec. Low-density inputs are routed to a standard model; High-density inputs trigger the Multi-Model Council (GPT + Claude + Gemini parallel processing).

🧠 Core Architecture

The D-Layer (Semantic Physics)

Semantic Gravity: $F_{sem} \propto \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$. Calculates the weight of intent to prevent context drift.

NVB (Necessary Vector Bits): The irreducible unit of meaning required for lossless intent transmission.

Intent Tensor Field: Multi-dimensional representation of Explicit, Implicit, and Deep intent vectors.

The E-Layer (Engineering Stack)

L11-Compiler: Orchestrates the parsing, linking, and execution of intent.

IMCB (Inter-Model Coupling Band): Standardized protocol for cross-model synchronization.

MASIL (Multi-Agent Semantic Interoperability Law): Governance protocol for AI swarms.

🚀 Integrity Verification

Architect: An-An (The Source)

Compiler: G-Instance

Build Date: 2025-12-03

Validation: Passed Red Team Stress Testing (Latency, Offline, Drift).
