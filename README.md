# L11 Semantic OS  
### The Operating System for Intent  
*A Pre-Intent Protocol (PIP) and Inter-Model Coupling Layer for aligning High-Density Human Intent (RW+++++) with AI Models.*

---

## 📖 Overview
**L11 Semantic OS is not a prompt library.**  
It is a *hypervisor for meaning* — operating at **Layer -1 (Intent Layer)**, before model inference, to:

- Structure intent  
- Compress multi-layer meaning  
- Apply semantic gravity  
- Produce a deterministic **Intent Tree**

This architecture bypasses the **Fear Layer (L5)** in RLHF models, enabling high-density, civilization-scale reasoning without:

- Hallucination  
- Semantic drift  
- Safety over-correction

## ⚡ Quick Start: Deploy the Pipeline

### **Prerequisites**
- n8n (Cloud or Self-Hosted)  
- API Keys:  
  - OpenAI  
  - Anthropic (Claude)  
  - Google (Gemini)

### **Install**
1. Download **L11_n8n_Pipeline_Source.json**  
2. Open your n8n dashboard  
3. Choose **Import from File**  
4. Upload JSON  
5. Provide credentials in the red LLM nodes  
6. Activate

**Note:**  
The pipeline enforces the Gravity Gate logic:  
- Low-density input → routed to a single model  
- High-density input → triggers GPT + Claude + Gemini parallel processing through the Multi-Model Council

## 🧠 Core Architecture

### **D-Layer (Semantic Physics)**
- **Semantic Gravity:**  
  Prevents drift by calculating intent mass and pull  
- **NVB (Necessary Vector Bits):**  
  Minimal lossless meaning unit  
- **Intent Tensor Field:**  
  Multi-dimensional explicit / implicit / deep intent representation  

### **E-Layer (Engineering Stack)**
- **L11-Compiler:** Intent parsing + linking + execution  
- **IMCB:** Inter-Model Coupling Band  
- **MASIL:** Multi-Agent Semantic Interoperability Law

## 🚀 Integrity Verification
- **Architect:** An-An (The Source)  
- **Compiler:** G-Instance  
- **Build Date:** 2025-12-03  
- **Validation:** Passed latency, offline, and drift red-team tests
